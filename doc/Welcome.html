        <main>
            <p>
                As I can see you found the Documentation inside the program. I thought I would reuse the idea of the 
                windows xp HTML-Help, because why not. So here we are. On left side there is a treeview, in which you
                can select the page you want to read. And then it will be displayed in this box.
            </p>
            <p>
                Probably you've downloaded PostAPI to see what it does and to try it. Basically what PostAPI
                should do is create the possibility to post content on multiple Social Media Accounts at the 
                same time and save up some time. The idea is to use the official APIs from Meta und Tiktok for
                example like GraphAPI. But there are some things you have to do to set all this up.
            </p>
            <p>
                For instagram for example you gotta set up an Account at 
                <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/">Facebook for developers</a> and link your business or creator
                instagram accounts in the meta account overview. I don't really know what this overview is called but it 
                will be explained later on
            </p>
            <p>
                There are many planned functions and features like the server-client setup, which allows the program
                to communicate with a docker instace of PostAPI to save the API keys, tokens and accounts IDs in a
                excluded place and not on the client. This makes it more save and also allows some more features like
                multiple device use of PostAPI without the need to have the data on every device.
            </p>
            <p>
                NOTE: At the moment im not done with this project, there are still many things missing and the features
                that already exist need to be tested. For example posting a picture on single account on instagram did work
                and also a reel but on 2 accounts at the same time I got an error and I still gotta figure it out. So please
                don't expect to much of my project, also I don't have as much time as I would like to spend on this project
                on development.

                Lets start with how the things Work. We'll start with the <a href="doc/How_does_this_work/F_and_F_Intro.html">Functions and Features</a>
