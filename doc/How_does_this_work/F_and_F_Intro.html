            <p>
                Here I'll explain the functions and features that PostAPI has or will have in the future. I'll 
                explain how these work and if there are some known bugs to it. I'll also guide you trough the
                program and explain how each feature works

            <div class="section">
                <h2>Planned Features</h2>
                <p>
                    So there are many planned features so I guess I'll just make a list here:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Instagram Posting (multiple Accounts on the same time)</li>
                        <li>Tiktok Posting (prolly multiple Account Posting aswell)</li>
                        <li>Server Client Mode</li>
                        <li>Account Manager GUI (currently just the json file)</li>
                        <li>Other platforms like Reddit, Youtube, Twitter or Threads. Maybe with a discord announcement bot or sum</li>
                        <li>Instagram Post Statistics like how many Likes or Views</li>
                        <li></li>
                        <li></li>
                    </ul>
